# Deep Learning for Point Clouds

This repository includes a <b>pytorch</b> implementation and training of a <b>PointNet for 3D point cloud classification</b>.

The included files are the following:
* `PointNet Pytorch Implementation.ipynb`: The PointNet implementation in pytorch and explains each step
* `PointNet Training and Evaluation.ipynb`: The training and evaluation of the PointNet with a subset of the <b>ShapeNet dataset</b>



## Results
The trained model achieved <b>93% accuracy</b> on the test set.
Results from the test set can be checked in the following confusion matrix.
